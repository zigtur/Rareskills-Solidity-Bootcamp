# Week16


## Questions

### 1 - The OZ upgrade tool for hardhat defends against 6 kinds of mistakes. What are they and why do they matter?


### 2 - What is a beacon proxy used for?



### 3 - Why does the openzeppelin upgradeable tool insert something like uint256[50] private __gap; inside the contracts? 
*Note: To see it, create an upgradeable smart contract that has a parent contract and look in the parent.*


### 4 - What is the difference between initializing the proxy and initializing the implementation? Do you need to do both? When do they need to be done?



### 5 - What is the use for the reinitializer? Provide a minimal example of proper use in Solidity
